This is the README file for alpha versions.

Note that this is a distribution of an alpha version.  That means,
that you have to be aware that the programs in this distribution may
still have a lot of bugs.

Nevertheless, if you are interested in hacking or just reading the
source code, keep going and give it a try.

Further documentation may be found in the files README and INSTALL, and
in the directory doc.

Please note that due to changing APIs we may rely on a specific Guile
version.  Check the README to find out which version we want.

Happy hacking!
