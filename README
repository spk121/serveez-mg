Description
===========

Serveez-MG is a Guile server framework.  It provides routines and help
for implementing IP based servers (currently TCP, UDP and ICMP).  It
is also possible to use named pipes for all connection oriented
protocols.

Many people need server functionality within their applications.
However, many people experience problems with select()- or
poll()-loops, and with non-blocking operations.

This application demonstrates various aspects of advanced network
programming.

You can use it for implementing your own servers or for understanding how
certain network services and operations work.

The package includes a couple of servers that work already: an HTTP
server, for example.  One of the highlights is that you can run
multiple protocols on the same port.  The application itself is single
threaded but it uses helper processes for concurrent name resolution
and ident lookups.

Serveez-MG was based on a much grander effort called GNU Serveez, which
aimed to be a generic server framework for multiple architectures.  It
can still be found on the http://www.gnu.org/software/serveez .
Unfortunately, it has not been updated in many years.


Requirements
============

Serveez-MG needs GNU Guile (Ubiquitous Intelligent Language for Extensions). 
This current version is known to work with Guile 1.9.14 and later.


Installation
============

Unpack the distribution tarball:

    $ tar xvzf serveez-mg-<version>.tar.gz               (using GNU tar)
    $ gzip -cd serveez-mg-<version>.tar.gz | tar xvf -   (using another tar)
  
Change into the source directory:

    $ cd serveez-mg-<version>
  
Configure the source package for your system:

    $ ./configure

Now compile the package:

    $ make
  
Install Serveez-MG:

    $ make install

You must have root privileges if you want to install the package in the
standard location (/usr/local) or in any location that is only writable 
by root.

If you have problems building the package out of the box, this is not
surprising.  This program has not been tested on a variety of
platforms, yet.

For further information on installing the package, please consult the
file INSTALL included in this distribution.


Getting the latest CVS snapshot
===============================

You can always get the latest Serveez-MG version from our Git
repository.  Please use an official release if you want to work with
Serveez-MG.  The Git version might not even compile.

The current repository is at git:git@github.com:spk121/serveez-mg.git
