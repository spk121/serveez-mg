.SH NAME
Serveez \- A server framework.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBserveez\fR [OPTION]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBServeez\fR is a server framework.  It provides routines and help for
implementing IP based servers (currently TCP, UDP and ICMP).  It is also
possible to use named pipes for all connection oriented protocols.

We think it is worth the effort because many people need server functionality 
within their applications.  However, many people experience problems 
with select()- or poll()-loops, and with non-blocking operations.

This application demonstrates various aspects of advanced network
programming in a portable manner.  It is known to compile and run on 
GNU/Linux systems, as well as on other 32-bit and 64-bit flavours of Unix 
and on Microsoft Windows (9x/ME/NT/2000/XP).

You can use it for implementing your own servers or for understanding how
certain network services and operations work.

The package includes a number of servers that work already: an HTTP server,
an IRC server, a Gnutella spider and some others.  One of the highlights is
that you can run all protocols on the same port.  The application itself is
single threaded but it uses helper processes for concurrent name resolution
and ident lookups.
