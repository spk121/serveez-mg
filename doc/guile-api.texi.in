@c included by `serveez.texi'.
@c

This section describes the Guile interface to Serveez which provides
the ability to write servers with Guile.  Of course, you could do this
without any help from Serveez, but it makes the task a lot easier.
This interface reduces the Guile implementation of an Internet server
to a simple data processor.

@subsubsection Special Data Types

Serveez extends Guile by various new data types which represent internal
data structures of Serveez's core API.

@itemize @bullet
@item @code{#<svz-servertype>}
represents a server type.
@item @code{#<svz-server>}
represents a server (an instance of a server type).
@item @code{#<svz-socket>}
represents a socket structure.
@end itemize

@subsubsection Passing Binary Data

The new binary data type (@code{#<svz-binary>}) provides access to any
kind of unstructured data.  It manages the data exchange between Guile
and Serveez.  There are some conversion functions for strings and lists
which help to process this binary data in a more complex (guile'ish) way.

@subsubsection Server Definition

In order to set up a new server type, you use the procedure
@code{(define-servertype!)}.  This procedure takes one argument which
must be an associative list specifying the server type in detail.
There are optional and mandatory elements you can set up in this alist.

The following example shows the overall syntax of this procedure:

@lisp
(define-servertype! '(

  ;; Mandatory: server type prefix for later use in (define-server!)
  (prefix          . "foo")

  ;; Mandatory: server type description
  (description     . "guile foo server")

  ;; Mandatory for TCP and PIPE servers: protocol detection
  (detect-proto    . foo-detect-proto)

  ;; Optional: global server type initialisation
  (global-init     . foo-global-init)

  ;; Optional: server instance initialisation
  (init            . foo-init)

  ;; Optional: server instance finalisation
  (finalize        . foo-finalize)

  ;; Optional: global server type finalisation
  (global-finalize . foo-global-finalize)

  ;; Mandatory for TCP and PIPE servers: socket connection
  (connect-socket  . foo-connect-socket)

  ;; Optional: server instance info
  (info-server     . foo-info-server)

  ;; Optional: client info
  (info-client     . foo-info-client)

  ;; Optional: server instance reset callback
  (reset           . foo-reset)
  
  ;; Optional: server instance notifier
  (notify          . foo-notify)
  
  ;; Mandatory for UDP and ICMP servers: packet handler
  (handle-request  . foo-handle-request)

  ;; Mandatory: server type configuration (may be an empty list)
  (configuration   . (

    ;; The server configuration is an alist (associative list) again.
    ;; Each item consists of an item name and a list describing the 
    ;; item itself.
    ;; Syntax: (key . (type defaultable default))
    (foo-integer       . (integer  #t 0))
    (foo-integer-array . (intarray #t (1 2 3 4 5)))
    (foo-string        . (string   #t "default-foo-string"))
    (foo-string-array  . (strarray #t ("guile" "foo" "server")))
    (foo-hash          . (hash     #t (("foo" . "bar"))))
    (foo-port          . (portcfg  #t foo-port))
    (foo-boolean       . (boolean  #t #t))
  ))))

@subsubsection Callback Prototypes

The Guile interface of Serveez is completely callback driven.
Callbacks can be set up in the associative list passed to
@code{(define-servertype!)}, or by using the predefined procedures
described in the previous section.  Each of the callbacks is passed
certain arguments and is meant to return specific values to indicate
success or failure.  This section describes each of these callbacks.

@table @code
@item (global-init #<svz-servertype>)
This callback is invoked once for every type of server right after
the @code{(define-servertype!)} statement.  Here you can initialise
resources shared between all instances of your server type.  The callback
is optional and can be set up in @code{(define-servertype!)}.  It should
return zero to indicate success and non-zero to indicate failure.  If the
global initialiser fails, Serveez will refuse to register the server type.

@item (global-finalize #<svz-servertype>)
If you want to free shared resources, which were possibly allocated
within the global initialiser, you can do so here.  The callback is
invoked when Serveez shuts down (issued by @code{(serveez-nuke)}) or the
server type gets unregistered for some reason.  It should return zero to
signal success.  The callback can be set up in @code{(define-servertype!)}
and is optional.

@item (init #<svz-server>)
Within this callback you can initialise everything you might need for
a single instance of your server.  The callback is invoked for each
server instance which has been created by @code{(define-server!)} and
should return zero to indicate success, otherwise Serveez rejects the
server instance.  The callback can be set up in @code{(define-servertype!)}
and is optional.

@item (finalize #<svz-server>)
The server instance finaliser gets its instance representation passed
as argument.  You need to free all resources used by this server
instance which might have been allocated within the server instance
initialiser or consumed while running.  You can set this callback in
the @code{(define-servertype!)} statement.  The callback is optional
and should return zero to indicate success.

@item (detect-proto #<svz-server> #<svz-socket>)
Connection oriented protocols like TCP and PIPE allow more than one
server to be listening on the same network port.  Therefore, it is
necessary to be able to detect the type of client connecting to a port.

This callback takes two arguments; the first is the server instance
and the second is the client socket object containing the client
connection information.  You can set up this callback in the
@code{(define-servertype!)} statement.

Serveez may invoke this callback several times as data becomes
available from the client until one of the servers recognises it.
The servers can retrieve the data received so far using the
@code{(svz:sock:receive-buffer)} call.

To indicate successful client detection, you need to return a non-zero
value.  (Note that for historical reasons, this is inconsistent with
other functions which return zero on successful completion.)  Once the
server has indicated success, Serveez invokes any further callbacks for
the connection only on that server.

If no server has recognised the client after the first 16 bytes, Serveez
will close the connection.  The connection will also be closed if the
client has not sent enough data for a server to recognise it within 30
seconds of connecting.

If multiple servers are listening on the same network port, Serveez
invokes this callback for each of them in an arbitrary order.  Only one
server at most should indicate successful detection.

This callback is mandatory for servers which get bound to
connection oriented protocol (TCP and PIPE) port configurations by
@code{(bind-server!)}.

@item (connect-socket #<svz-server> #<svz-socket>)
If the client detection signalled success, this callback is invoked to
assign the client connection to a server instance.  The arguments are
the same as the detection callback.  In this callback you can assign
all the connection specific callbacks for your server and perform some
initial tasks.  Basically you should specify the @code{handle-request}
and/or @code{check-request} callback.  This can be achieved by calling
@code{(svz:sock:handle-request)} and @code{(svz:sock:check-request)}.
The @code{connect-socket} callback is also mandatory for connection
oriented protocols and must be defined in @code{(define-servertype!)}.
On success you should return zero, otherwise the connection will be
shutdown by Serveez.

@item (info-server #<svz-server>)
This callback gets invoked when requested by the builtin
@ref{Control Protocol Server}.  The callback is optional and can be
set up in @code{(define-servertype!)}.  The returned character string
can be multiple lines separated by @code{\r\n} (but without a trailing
separator).  Usually you will return information about the server instance
configuration and/or state.

@item (info-client #<svz-server> #<svz-socket>)
This callback is optional.  You can set it up in the 
@code{(define-servertype!)} procedure.  It is meant to provide socket
structure specific information.  (The socket structure is a client/child
of the given server instance.)  You need to return a single line
character string without trailing newlines.  The information provided
can be requested by the builtin @ref{Control Protocol Server}.

@item (notify #<svz-server>)
The server instance notifier callback will be invoked whenever there is idle
time available.  In practice, it is run approximately once a second.
A server instance can use it to perform periodic tasks.  The callback
is optional and can be set up in @code{(define-servertype!)}.

@item (reset #<svz-server>)
This callback is invoked when the Serveez process receives a @code{SIGHUP} 
signal which can be issued via @samp{killall -HUP serveez} from user
land.  If the underlying operating system does not provide @code{SIGHUP}
there is no use for this callback.  It provides the possibility to 
perform asynchronous tasks scheduled from outside Serveez.  You can
optionally set it up in the @code{(define-servertype!)} procedure.

@item (handle-request #<svz-socket> #<svz-binary> size)
This callback is invoked whenever a complete packet has been detected
in the receive buffer.  The packet data is passed to the callback as a
@code{#<svz-binary>}.  The @var{size} argument is passed for convenience
and specifies the length of the packet in bytes.

The detection, and therefore the invocation, can be made in one of two
ways.  When Serveez can determine itself when a packet is complete, the
callback will be invoked directly.  Serveez can make this determination
for connections with packet oriented protocols such as UDP and ICMP, or
if you tell Serveez how to parse the packet using
@code{(svz:sock:boundary sock delimiter)} or 
@code{(svz:sock:boundary sock size)} and do not specify a 
@code{check-request} callback.

Whenever you specify a @code{check-request} callback to determine when
a packet is complete, it becomes the responsiblity of that callback to
invoke @code{handle-request} itself.

Serveez recognises two different return value meanings.  For connection
oriented protocols (TCP and PIPE), zero indicates success and non-zero
failure; on failure, Serveez will shutdown the connection.  For packet
oriented protocols (UDP and ICMP), a non-zero return value indicates
that your server was able to process the passed packet data, otherwise
(zero return value) the packet can be passed to other servers listening
on the same port configuration.

This callback must be specified in @code{(define-servertype!)} for
packet oriented protocols (UDP and ICMP) but is optional otherwise.
You can modify the callback by calling @code{(svz:sock:handle-request)}.

@item (check-request #<svz-socket>)
This callback is invoked whenever new data has arrived in the receive buffer.
The receive buffer of the given @code{#<svz-socket>} can be obtained
using @code{(svz:sock:receive-buffer)}.  The callback is initially not
set and can be set up with @code{(svz:sock:check-request)}.  Its purpose
is to check whether a complete request was received.  If so, it should
be handled (by running the @code{handle-request} callback) and removed
from the receive buffer (using @code{(svz:sock:receive-buffer-reduce)}).
The callback is for connection oriented protocols (TCP and PIPE) only.
You should return zero to indicate success and non-zero to indicate
failure.  On failure Serveez shuts the connection down.

@item (disconnected #<svz-socket>)
The @code{disconnected} callback gets invoked whenever the socket is
lost for some external reason and is going to be shutdown by Serveez.
It can be set up with @code{(svz:sock:disconnected)}.

@item (kicked #<svz-socket> reason)
This callback gets invoked whenever the socket gets closed by Serveez
intentionally.  It can be set up with @code{(svz:sock:kicked)}.  The
@var{reason} argument can be either @code{KICK_FLOOD}, indicating the
socket is a victim of the builtin flood protection, or @code{KICK_QUEUE}
which indicates a send buffer overflow.

@item (idle #<svz-socket>)
The @code{idle} callback gets invoked from the periodic task scheduler,
which maintains a @code{idle-counter} for each socket structure.
This counter is decremented whenever Serveez becomes idle and the
callback is invoked when it drops to zero.  The @code{idle} callback can
set its socket's @code{idle-counter} to some value with the procedure
@code{(svz:sock:idle-counter)} and thus re-schedule itself for a later
task.  You can set up this callback with @code{(svz:sock:idle)}.

@item (trigger-condition #<svz-socket>)
This callback is invoked once every server loop for the socket structure.
If you return @code{#f} nothing else is happening.  Otherwise the 
@code{trigger} callback will be invoked immediately.  You can set up the 
callback using the procedure @code{(svz:sock:trigger-condition)}.

@item (trigger #<svz-socket>)
The @code{trigger} callback is invoked when the @code{trigger-condition} 
returns @code{#t}.  The callback can be set up with the procedure 
@code{(svz:sock:trigger)}.  Returning a non-zero value shuts the 
connection down.  A zero return value indicates success.  This callback
can be used to perform connection related updates, e.g. you can ensure
a certain send buffer fill.

@item (check-oob-request #<svz-socket> oob-byte)
This callback is invoked whenever urgent data (out-of-band) has been detected 
on a socket.  Initially this event is ignored and the callback can be set 
up with the procedure @code{(svz:sock:check-oob-request)}.  The 
@var{oob-byte} argument is a number containing the received out-of-band
data byte ranging from 0 to 255.  If the callback returns non-zero the
connection will be shutdown.  A zero return value indicates success.  You
can use @code{(svz:sock:send-oob)} to send a single out-of-band data byte.

@strong{Please note}:
The urgent data is not supported by all operating systems.  Also it does
not work for all types of network protocols.  We verified it to be working
for TCP streams on GNU/Linux 2.x.x and Windows 95;  let us know if/how it 
works on other platforms.
